A Repository:
  - Repository- a folder that contains related items, such as files, images, videos, or even other folders
  - Repositories often include a README file
  - To create a repository, look in the upper-right corner of any page, click select, and then click New repository

Creating a Branch:
  - Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time
  - You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main

Making Changes:
  - Saved changes are called commits
  - Commit messages capture the history of your changes

Pull Request:
  - Pulling a request is proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch
  - After you merge your pull request, the changes on your readme-edits branch will be incorporated into main
